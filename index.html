                        <p class="text-muted">The ADDS graduate certificate will be offered online. The slate of courses will not only provide students with opportunities to study digital content using a digital platform,
                         but would give them experience using and thinking through real-world applications for their work.   Platforms like Canvas are designed to provide storage space for housing papers, email discussions, and syllabi.
                           They are largely meant to be invisible
                          backdrops or repositories for course content.  In sharp contrast, new platforms like Slack (see short video below) are designed to facilitate live conversation and interactive learning.
                        The ADDS certificate would make good use of leading course delivery platforms that foreground collaborative opportunities and facilitate exceptional student engagement opportunities.

                        <p class="text-muted"><span style="color:black;"><b>Course development timeline (see table below)</b></span>: We propose to bring courses online in an incremental process. 
                        Our strategy is to test each course out in a hybrid fashion before moving fully online. Fickas has used this strategy successfully with undergrad CS courses; he won a UO Williams Fellowship
                        in 2015 based on the inventiveness of this approach. The first course is hybrid in that
                        only local students will be allowed to enroll, and instructor help will be available for face-to-face meetings with students. At the conclusion of the hybrid course, Instructors will craft an
                        online help and discussion component for the online version of the course based on their experiences and student responses to the hybrid course.
                        <br><br>
                        We have also included a row for adding additional courses to the ADDS certificate in summer 2019 to support a full Master's program, which is part of our future plans.
                        <br><br>
                        The full certificate program will be ready by summer 2019. With each first offering, we will simultaneously submit
                        a course-approval form to the Graduate School Curriculum Committee.

		<p class="text-muted"><span style="color:black;"><b>Program staffing timeline (see table below)</b></span>: We can roughly divide course staffing between a 2-year start-up period
		and an ongoing maintenance period with the possibility of growing toward an online Master's program. The major decision point will be summer 2019. At that point a favorable review
		 of the Certificate program will prompt a request to hire a Tenure-Track faculty line in Digital Public Humanities to support further development of the Master's program.
		<br><br>
		The course software developer and associated GTF will focus on the
		online platform, i.e., the tools needed to support our new courses. Supported by a UO Williams Fellowship, Fickas has a start on such a platform for online CS courses he teaches now. Please request a demo if interested.</p>

                    converted to a TTF. It also assumes that starting year 3, an effort to extend the ADDS certificate to a fully online MS program will commence. If different decisions are

   					<p class="text-muted"><span style="color:black;"><b>Income estimates</b></span>: ADDS Tuition revenue comes from online enrollment.  Instructors will design courses to be fully accessible outside of the certificate trajectory, thereby allowing students to enroll in individual courses without the obligation to pursue a certificate.
   					Looking at the courses separately:</p>
   					<ul>
   					
   					<li style="font-size: 20px"><p class="text-muted">Non-major computer science courses remain in demand on campus. The CIS department enrolls roughly 1000 non-majors during the academic year. Courses 2 and 3 are
   					computer science courses that will
   					be designed to allow interested graduate students to take both courses outside of the ADDS certificate. Again using CIS courses as a basis, we expect that many non-certificate students will switch to the
   					certificate track once they are hooked by courses 2 and 3.
					</p></li>
					
					<li style="font-size: 20px"><p class="text-muted">Course 4 is crucial to the work being done at universities around the world. Like courses 2 and 3, Course 4 could be taken separately
					 from the certificate program for those interested in learning basic skills in digital scholarship. 
					</p></li>
					
					<li style="font-size: 20px"><p class="text-muted">Courses 1 and 5 give the Certificate coherence and coalescence. Enrollment depends on our ability to attract students to the ADDS program.
					</p></li>

Ohio State:<br>
Department: Open<br>
Position: Computational Humanities<br>
Rank: Open<br>
<br>
Description:
</b>
The College of Arts and Sciences at The Ohio State University invites nominations and applications for a tenured or tenure-track position in computational humanities, beginning autumn semester 2017. The designated rank is open; the departmental home is open. We conceive of computational humanities broadly, as a field that uses computational methodologies to change or pursue research questions in the humanities, or creates human- and machine-readable databases to catalogue knowledge in the humanities. Research and teaching interests might include network theory and analysis, stylistic analysis, text mining, visualization and mapping, technologies of reading, or computational literary criticism. This position is partially funded by Ohio State University’s Discovery Themes, a significant faculty hiring investment in key thematic areas in which the university can build on its culture of academic collaboration to make a global impact. The successful candidate will be involved in developing computational humanities through research, teaching, and program building.
<br>
<br>
<b>Qualifications</b>: Applicants are expected to have a Ph.D. and to present evidence of excellence in teaching and research. Preference will be given to candidates with a strong record of cross-disciplinary collaboration.
